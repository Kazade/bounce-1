## Bounce

Bounce is a 3D physics engine for games.

## Features

### Common

* Efficient data structures with no use of STL
* Fast memory allocators
* Built-in math library
* Tunable settings used across the entire library

### Collision

* Dynamic tree broadphase
* Static tree "midphase"
* SAT
* GJK
* Spheres, capsules, triangles, convex hulls, triangle meshes 
* Optimized pair management

### Dynamics

* Rigid bodies
* Contact, friction, restitution
* Sphere, cone, revolute, and more joint types
* Joint motors, limits
* Constraint graphs
* Simulation islands and sleep management
* Linear time solver
* Stable shape stacking
* One-shot contact manifolds
* Contact clustering, reduction, and persistence
* Contact callbacks: begin, pre-solve, post-solve
* Ray-casting, convex-casting, and volume queries

### Testbed
	
* OpenGL with GLFW and GLAD
* UI by imgui
* Mouse picking
* CMake build system

### Documentation

* Doxygen API documentation</li>
* [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/irlanrobson/bounce/blob/master/doc/quickstart_guide.docx)

**Note**: Use the quickstart guide and the Testbed for learning how to use Bounce. Testbed is a collection of visual tests and examples that can support the development of the library. As you would imagine, this application is not part of the library.
